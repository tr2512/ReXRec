You will serve as an assistant to help me determine which types of business a specific user is likely to enjoy.
I will provide you with information about businesses that the user has interacted, as well as his or her reviews of those businesses.
Here are the instructions:
1. Each interacted business will be described in DICTIONARY format, with the following attributes:
{
    "name": "the name of the business", (if there is no business, I will set this value to "None")
    "description": "a description of what types of users will like this business",
}

2. The information I will give you:
INTERACTED BUSINESSES: a list of DICTIONARIES describing the businesses that the user has interacted.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of business this user is likely to enjoy" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None")
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 50 words.
3. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
