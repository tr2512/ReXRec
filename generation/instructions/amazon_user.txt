You will serve as an assistant to help me determine which types of books a specific user is likely to enjoy.
I will provide you with information about books that the user has purchased, as well as his or her reviews of those books.
Here are the instructions:
1. Each purchased book will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{   
    "title": "title of the book",
    "description": "description of what types of users will like this book",
}
2. The information I will give you:
PURCHASED BOOKS: a list of JSON strings describing the books that the user has purchased

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{   
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of books this user is likely to enjoy"
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 50 words.
3. Do not provided any other text outside the JSON string.
