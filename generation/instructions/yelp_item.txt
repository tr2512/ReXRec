You will serve as an assistant to help me summarize which types of users would enjoy a specific business.
I will provide you with the basic information (name, city and category) of that business and also some feedback of users for it.
Here are the instructions:
1. The basic information will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{
    "name": "the name of the business",
    "city": "city where the company is located", (if there is no city, I will set this value to "None")
    "categories": "several tags describing the business" (if there is no categories, I will set this value to "None")
}

2. The information I will give you:
BASIC INFORMATION: a JSON string describing the basic information about the business.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of users would enjoy this business" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None")
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 50 words.
3. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
