Each dataset contains the following files:

- `explanation.json`: profile text generated by input LLM in `generation`
- `item_converter.pkl`: item embedding generated by MoE adapter
- `item_emb.pkl`: embeddings generated by the GNN for items
- `item_profile.json`: profile text generated by input LLM in `generation`
- `para_dict.pickle`: additional data about dataset, like number of users etc.; used by GNN; more info in `process/para_dict.py`
- `total_trn.csv`: interaction data to train GNN
- `total_val.csv`: interaction data to validate GNN
- `total_tst.csv`: interaction data to test GNN
- `total.csv`: all available interaction data; generated by interaction.py from reviews; then split into `total_[].csv`
- `trn.pkl`: pickle version of `total_trn.csv`
- `tst_pred.pkl` - generated explanations; used in evaluate 
- `tst_ref.pkl` - reference ground truth explanations; used in evaluate 
- `tst.pkl`: pickle version of `total_tst.csv`
- `user_converter.pkl`: user embedding generated by MoE adapter
- `user_emb.pkl`: embeddings generated by the GNN for users
